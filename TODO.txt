for certain eqns ban negatives
show title in dcf graph with chemical CLARIFY
canvas js add 0 axis lines
allow db/dt as input on right side
make toggles tabs 
update y axis mfc
make x range wider
add another heatmap

when edit eqn name and select other it breaks 
when edit file name and select it again it breaks
make clickaway work

publish only updated Sustainability
make only one request per load perhaps 
reset all pos
same width textbox
format graph config
refresh token
perhaps place config button in chart
on close graph config, dont close graph

Clarify
========
    change to pqrs
    
    D) Separate Math code from graph code
    E) replace array use with x_0, y_0 syntax
    F) Cover at least the mathmodule



Themes
========
    Alternative chart libs
    get a better heat map package
    when all values are 0 the colours are still there so find a better normalisation
    find a heatmap normalisation
    Write code to convert $data/xls/* xls to $data/json/*
    responsive designs
    1 heatmap per file
    reformat Folders
    use only one heatmap form perhaps
