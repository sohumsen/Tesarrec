D) Separate Math code from graph code
E) replace array use with x_0, y_0 syntax
F) Cover at least the mathmodule

reset the error message when there is a good equnation
chart properties should be a settings
a) legend position
b) rounding percision
Tooltip show line name, round to N decimal 
make dustmin in line with error message
get a better heat map package
when all values are 0 the colours are still there so find a better normalisation
find a heatmap normalisation
Write code to convert $data/xls/* xls to $data/json/*
add the ui tabs
enlarge pic on click



make text field bg white with shadow when selected
Variable Descfiption of a , b , c has default values from Mama but user can override
( when user presses submit )
Alternative chart libs
error handling
responsive designs
change to pqrs
delte the last eqn and watch
