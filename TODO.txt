show title in dcf graph with chemical CLARIFY
allow db/dt as input on right side CLARIFY


for certain eqns ban negatives
canvas js add 0 axis lines
make toggles tabs 
update y axis mfc
make x range wider
add another heatmap
publish only updated Sustainability


when edit eqn name and select other it breaks 
when edit file name and select it again it breaks
make clickaway work

make only one request per load perhaps 


only allow unique variables
change file nav format

fix all values to 2dp
fix dynamic mes
reset all react grid pos

Clarify
========
    change to pqrs
    
    D) Separate Math code from graph code
    E) replace array use with x_0, y_0 syntax
    F) Cover at least the mathmodule



Themes
========
    Alternative chart libs
    get a better heat map package
    when all values are 0 the colours are still there so find a better normalisation
    find a heatmap normalisation
    Write code to convert $data/xls/* xls to $data/json/*
    responsive designs
    1 heatmap per file
    reformat Folders
    use only one heatmap form perhaps
