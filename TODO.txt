D) Separate Math code from graph code
E) replace array use with x_0, y_0 syntax
F) Cover at least the mathmodule

chart properties should be a settings
    a) legend position DONE
    b) rounding percision
Tooltip show line name, round to N decimal 
get a better heat map package
when all values are 0 the colours are still there so find a better normalisation
find a heatmap normalisation
Write code to convert $data/xls/* xls to $data/json/*



make text field bg white with shadow when selected
Variable Descfiption of a , b , c has default values from Mama but user can override
( when user presses submit )
Alternative chart libs
error handling
responsive designs
change to pqrs
change the favicon DONE BUT TEST
plot graph under production rate
widen about page
make sliders small
1 heatmap per file



Audit
========

1. Cleanup Dead Files   DONE
2. Cleanup Old Folders  - TBD
5. Github Commits  27/5 - Excellent

3. WriteUp a project description in Readme.md  . 27/05 - 0/10 DONE
4. Suggested Convention - https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsguide.html

6. Test Code - Key modules identified *New Code Structure needed*
